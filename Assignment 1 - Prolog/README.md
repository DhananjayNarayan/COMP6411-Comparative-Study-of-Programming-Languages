## Assignment 1 on Prolog

To-do:
 - Figure out about the default constructors
 - modify the facts to get the exact output from the PDF given. Eg., android -> 'Android', android2 -> 'Android2'
 - create a new file for rules and then import the facts.pl file
 - In PDF, it's asked to submit 3 files. But it should be 4. As there would be 2 .pl files. Each for facts and rules.
